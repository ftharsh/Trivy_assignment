## Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Passport.js is used for authentication, and role-based access control can be implemented.
  
- **Session Management:** Users are limited to one device at a time.

- **API Throttling and Rate Limiting:** Implemented using Express middleware.

- **CRUD Operations:** API routes for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

- **Error Handling:** Standardized format for error responses.

## CI/CD Workflow

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment. On every push or merge to the master branch, the workflow runs tests and deploys the application.
